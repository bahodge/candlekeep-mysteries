This thin book bears no title inside or out. Its covers are cracked, unvarnished thin sheets of black oak covered with bird scratches and indentations that have obviously been made by pecking beaks. Bound with black wire between these covers are 33 pages that have yellowed with age and wrinkled from moisture. Each page bears tiny, blotchy brown script written in an unsteady hand by an unidentified author.

Firsthand account of an anonymous author who, after falling off her horse and breaking her leg, was rescued and befriended by [[Vistani]] travelers who graciously nursed her back to health. It mentions two [[Vistani]] people, a girl named [[Drasha]] and a teen boy named [[Darzin]]. The story tells the tale of a journey through impenetrable mist, thick forest, crackling fires on cold nights, wolves howling in the dead of night and ravens pecking on the rough of the wagon in the wee hours of the morning. Late in the book and in contrast to the cheery demenour of the journey with the [[Vistani]], the author describes arriving at dreadful castle. The writing abruptly ends on the third-to-last page, suggesting that the book was ripped from the author's hands mid sentence. The last 2 pages are blank.

Upon close inspection, there is a small slit in inner wall of the back cover. It contains a map.
