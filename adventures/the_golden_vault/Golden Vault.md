## Notes
One day as we are meeting up for coffee, we notice a key inside of the cup is a key with a book attached. 

We must infiltrate a fortress called Brimstone Hold. We have a contact N who works there to help steal a book. We think that N has their own agenda as well.

We know that there are ifritis somewhere in Brimstone Hold.

We travel towards Brimstone and stay at the H.O.E trading post. We arrive at the trading post. All the boats that are hitched up are all owned by the brimstone prison complex. 

There is a harbormaster. We learn that the captains of the boats are in the trading post. For information, we pay the harbor master 1gp

We walk into the HOE tavern and it is run by Cambion and Succubi. We see a table with 3 people who stand out.

We see 1 duerger. Named Durza. Employeer named V. Time is money as he always says.
We see 1 aronyes
We see 1 other person

We learn that there is a red dragon that ate some prisoners.

Vault 713

we all retire for the evening. And nothing strange happens in the night.

---
We meet Durza in the morning and ask about "N". He is unable to help us. We set sail on the ship to the Brimstone Hold.

As we are sailing, we see some Lava Sharks. We learn we should be careful around the boss and make sure that we don't make them mad.

We are taken to a waiting room to wait for the boss.
