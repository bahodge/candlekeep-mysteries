The ancient white dragon that haunts Hoarfrost Crown has unleashed its fury upon the valley, turning the land into a frozen graveyard. Once contained to its own peak, the dragon’s storms now spill down the slopes, creeping ever closer to Dûrmhark, the mountain you call home. The ice chokes the valley below, and soon, the blizzards will climb your own slopes, sealing your halls in frost and burying your forges beneath the snow.

Brynmor Stonedancer, matriarch of Khaldór-Thrim, has summoned you—her greatest champions—to stop this threat before it is too late. The dragon has turned Hoarfrost Crown into a throne of ice, and if left unchecked, Dûrmhark will be next. The warmth of your people’s forges, the legacy of your ancestors, and the very survival of your home hangs in the balance. Will you rise to meet this threat before your mountain is lost to the cold?

We Arrive at the mountain and meet [[Brynmor Stonedancer]]. We meet [[Ustrum Breeview]] and he will accompany us on our mission.

At the base of the mountain, there has been a lot of frost giant activity at the foot of the mountain. They are bringing large beasts to feed the white dragon.

Priority 1 would be to ground the dragon and keep it from flying away.

Halfway up the mountain, there is a tunnel we will have to pass through. Beyond the tunnel is a forest and temple to the dwarven gods.

At the top of the mountain is a frozen lake where we will presumable find the Dragon.

We arrive at the foot of the mountain

We see that this is the domain of the dragon. There is a glacial gloom obscuring the area. We see a switchback path going up the mountain.
