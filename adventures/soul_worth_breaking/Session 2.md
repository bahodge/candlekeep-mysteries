## The plan
1. [[Leith]] dresses like librarian.
2. [[Leith]] impersonates the library.
3. [[Jax]] and [[Falice]] forge letters and notes saying that the librarian is going into hiding.
4. [[Jax]] and [[Falice]] dispose of the bodies of the librarian and her husband

## Library
[[Leith]] goes to the library and is seen by a few guards. She hears a knock in the door and it is [[Lucian Veilcross]] coming to add another entry to his biography. We learn that [[Lucian Veilcross]] doesn't like [[Cedric Vail]] and accuses them of stealing the biography. Possibly [[Berrick]] the gladiator fighter from the pits. [[Cedric Vail]] is more active in tarnishing [[Lucian Veilcross]]' name.

## Librarian's House
[[Jax]] and [[Falice]] get rid of the bodies by storing the bodies of the librarian and her husband in the sewers near the Martial Quarter.

We decide to head to the [[Crimson Pit]]. We see [[Lucian Veilcross]] and his guard going to the Archavist's house.

We arrive and ask about [[Berrick]]. We talk to the bookie and get info on [[Berrick]]. He generally wants to challenge [[Lucian Veilcross]] to a duel.

---
We walk by the Archavist's house and there are guards around. We ask about the investigator who is casting spells. It is [[Helena Drayton]]

We go to the graveyard. It is called Silent Rest Graveyard. We go into the graveyard and meet the grave keeper. We tell them we want to see the graves of the warriors of [[Dunmere]]. We see [[Alric Kane]] and some of the widows. We charm the gravekeeper and distract him. We learn that most people don't know about the atrocities committed by [[Lucian Veilcross]]. [[Alric Kane]] was there visiting the memorial with [[Beatrice Langly]]. Her sister was killed in the fighting at [[Dunmere]].

We would need compelling evidence. We might be able to use his biography.

---
We trick the guards in the Nobel quarter and get to the Chateau Veil. It is a house that resides in the shadow of the city's wall. We are granted an audience with [[Cedric Vail]] to audition for the ball.

We perform a audition and impress [[Cedric Vail]]. Some people say that he only destroyed the city to prevent peasants from walking in through the city in the noble. [[Lucian Veilcross]] also learn that he has a forbidden lover. Before [[Lucian Veilcross]] became a paladin he was betrothed.

We need to do a performance that sheds [[Lucian Veilcross]] in a bad light.

We have access to the ballroom to prepare/practice. We are given a note that says we can enter Chateau Veil once to prep for the ball and once the night of the event.

---

We sit and read the biography. It is a large book. The book is written in a way that shows him in a really good light. He really doesn't want to fade away. He wants to be remembered. He is requisitioning a statue to be put in the entry of the city. It seems very rough. There are revisions and notes. 

Muriel is on the stage at the tavern. There are two striders in the tavern who say a bunch of really uncomfortable things. One of them is [[Lucian Veilcross]] when his disguise is dispelled.

--- 
 We go to the graveyard and we dig up [[Beatrice Langly]]'s sister's body. [[Annette Langly]] is questioned about the events at [[Dunmere]]. She tells us that [[Lucian Veilcross]] told her to go to the town hall and heal and didn't evacuate the civilians. They likely were used as bait. She noticed that no captains were around during
