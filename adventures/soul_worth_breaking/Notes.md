## Mission

We serve the  [[Ginzeval]], collector of souls and corruption. He has set his sights on [[Lucian Veilcross]] in [[Eldoria]].

We must find [[Lucian Veilcross]] find his cracks and widen them until he breaks. Basically we need to corrupt [[Lucian Veilcross]] to make corrupting everyone else.
We will probably have to discover multiple weaknesses and use them all to corrupt [[Lucian Veilcross]]. We don't want to want to kill them, we want to corrupt them.

---
## Briefing
We speak with [[Ginzeval]]. He tells us that we need high level souls for the battle the celestials.

[[Eldoria]] was the target years ago but [[Lucian Veilcross]] foiled the attack. There was a rift that was opened just outside the city but the [[Ginzeval]]'s forces were stopped at [[Dunmere]]. [[Lucian Veilcross]] used the mountain to crush the city and stop the attack. [[Lucian Veilcross]] might feel guilty about it.

[[Eldoria]] is closely aligned to [[Lethander]]. [[Ginzeval]] gives us a map of [[Eldoria]]. We also learn that [[Eldoria]]ns do not like devils or tieflings so we can use that against them.

[[Lucian Veilcross]] is the commander of the city and likely would be near the castle.

We are given the contract to bind [[Lucian Veilcross]] to [[Ginzeval]]. Once the contract is signed, [[Ginzeval]] will be notified.

## Road to East Gate

We are teleported to the East Gate and appear in some nearby woods. We meet a dwarf who tells us that there is a great live music show in the [[Gilded Tankard Tavern]] in the merchant's quarter.

[[Leith]] sings a song for the road and we meet [[Bael Hardhelm]]. We ask about some gossip in the town. He heard that the nobles were having a masquerade. Perhaps we can get a contract to play at the show.

We need a travel card to enter [[Eldoria]]. [[Bael Hardhelm]] says that the line on the right is corrupt and we can get into the city.

## East Gate

We get into the right line. There is a long line to enter the city. We distract all the people in line and get to the front of the line faster. The name of the guard that we buy the pass from is [[Sergeant Vaylin]].

# Eldoria

We enter the city of [[Eldoria]]. The gate is a stone wall that is 20ft high with a portculis. The city looks very well defended and the road is cobblestone.

The road is flanked by large statues. We go to the [[Gilded Tankard Tavern]].

## Gilded Tankard Tavern

There are not many patrons there. We head in to the tavern to secure accomodation. Tonight the tavern has [[Muriel Everstone]] playing in the evening. So maybe we can talk to her.

We are unable to secure a slot to perform in the tavern over the weekend. We head up to the rooms.

We learn that the poor side of town is the eastbank. The west bank is the wealthier side of town. There is also a library of [[Eldoria]].

## Castle

We go to the castle and figure out what [[Lucian Veilcross]] looks like.

## Library

A cathedral looking library made of stone and stuff. Two stone lions flank the front entrance. We enter library. It smells musty inside. At the front desk is an older looking woman with grey hair.

We learn that [[Lucian Veilcross]] comes to the library describing visions. He comes to the library and gets his biographical story recorded by the librarian.

We murder the librarian and steal the biography.

## Tavern

We see a veteran and drink with them. He tells us that [[Lucian Veilcross]] betrayed the army when he collapsed the cliffs with his own catapults. [[Lucian Veilcross]] was hailed as a hero. The veteran's name is Captain [[Alric Kane]]. There were many bodies taken to the graveyard.

We notice that [[Muriel Everstone]] has a silver chain around her neck but we cannot see the locket or amulet at the end of the chain.

We can get tickets to the nobles ball from [[Cedric Vail]]. We can probably pay 100gp each ticket to get in to the ball. The ball is next week. [[Lucian Veilcross]] will be there.

## The plan
1. [[Leith]] dresses like librarian.
2. [[Leith]] impersonates the library.
3. [[Jax]] and [[Falice]] forge letters and notes saying that the librarian is going into hiding.
4. [[Jax]] and [[Falice]] dispose of the bodies of the librarian and her husband

## Library
[[Leith]] goes to the library and is seen by a few guards. She hears a knock in the door and it is [[Lucian Veilcross]] coming to add another entry to his biography. We learn that [[Lucian Veilcross]] doesn't like [[Cedric Vail]] and accuses them of stealing the biography. Possibly [[Berrick]] the gladiator fighter from the pits. [[Cedric Vail]] is more active in tarnishing [[Lucian Veilcross]]' name.

## Librarian's House
[[Jax]] and [[Falice]] get rid of the bodies by storing the bodies of the librarian and her husband in the sewers near the Martial Quarter.

---
We decide to head to the [[Crimson Pit]]. We see [[Lucian Veilcross]] and his guard going to the Archavist's house.

We arrive and ask about [[Berrick]]. We talk to the bookie and get info on [[Berrick]]. He generally wants to challenge [[Lucian Veilcross]] to a duel.

---
We walk by the Archavist's house and there are guards around. We ask about the investigator who is casting spells. It is [[Helena Drayton]]

We go to the graveyard. It is called Silent Rest Graveyard. We go into the graveyard and meet the grave keeper. We tell them we want to see the graves of the warriors of [[Dunmere]]. We see [[Alric Kane]] and some of the widows. We charm the gravekeeper and distract him. We learn that most people don't know about the atrocities committed by [[Lucian Veilcross]]. [[Alric Kane]] was there visiting the memorial with [[Beatrice Langly]]. Her sister was killed in the fighting at [[Dunmere]].

We would need compelling evidence. We might be able to use his biography.

---
We trick the guards in the Nobel quarter and get to the Chateau Veil. It is a house that resides in the shadow of the city's wall. We are granted an audience with [[Cedric Vail]] to audition for the ball.

We perform a audition and impress [[Cedric Vail]]. Some people say that he only destroyed the city to prevent peasants from walking in through the city in the noble. [[Lucian Veilcross]] also learn that he has a forbidden lover. Before [[Lucian Veilcross]] became a paladin he was betrothed.

We need to do a performance that sheds [[Lucian Veilcross]] in a bad light.

We have access to the ballroom to prepare/practice. We are given a note that says we can enter Chateau Veil once to prep for the ball and once the night of the event.

---

We sit and read the biography. It is a large book. The book is written in a way that shows him in a really good light. He really doesn't want to fade away. He wants to be remembered. He is requisitioning a statue to be put in the entry of the city. It seems very rough. There are revisions and notes. 

Muriel is on the stage at the tavern. There are two striders in the tavern who say a bunch of really uncomfortable things. One of them is [[Lucian Veilcross]] when his disguise is dispelled.

--- 
 We go to the graveyard and we dig up
