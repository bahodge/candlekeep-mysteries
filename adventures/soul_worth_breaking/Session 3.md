[[Ginzeval]] has deemed that we need some help and has decided to send a new helper (Taylor) tiefling. [[Guile]] joins the party. [[Guile]] casts find object and finds [[Lucian Veilcross]]'s house.

We travel towards the west and find [[Lucian Veilcross]]'s castle. We get to the gates and try to convince the guards to let us into the house. We convince the chamberlain that we are there to do a fitting for [[Lucian Veilcross]] for the ball.

We cast a bunch of spells and convince the chamberlain to give us a tour of the entire house.  We loot the keys off of the Chamberlain. We end up killing the Chamberlain and burning his body. The body emits black smoke.

We found a locket in the chest inside of a silver necklace (half locket) shaped as a half heart. 

We split up inside of the house and search different rooms.

We find a map of the city that has pins in it marking several locations in the town.
1. One of the pins is labeled thieves guild on the bazzar
2. Stoneward hold, guard's headquarters with a note "corruption"
3. One over the crimson pit, "threats"
4. one on chateau veil, "upstart"
5. on on the temple "profaner"

Additionally, in the same room, there is a short sword that looks very out of place.

We find [[Lucian Veilcross]]'s bodyguard's room. His name is Sir [[Rodrick Thorn]]. We find a letter proclaiming his loyalty to [[Lucian Veilcross]].

We go down a secret staircase in the private study. We find a dry bar with many alcohol bottles. We break open a drawer and find a journal. It goes over the events of the [[Dunmere]] campaign. It says that there was a second army.

We also find something glinting in the trash and it is a torn up medal for honor at [[Dunmere]]. We also find a longsword. It is ornately crafted and it has an inscription on the blade "to my brother in arms, Alric". Likely meant for [[Alric Kane]].
