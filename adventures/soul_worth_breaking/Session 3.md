[[Ginzeval]] has deemed that we need some help and has decided to send a new helper (Taylor) tiefling. [[Guile]] joins the party. [[Guile]] casts find object and finds [[Lucian Veilcross]]'s house.

We travel towards the west and find [[Lucian Veilcross]]'s castle. We get to the gates and try to convince the guards to let us into the house. We convince the chamberlain that we are there to do a fitting for [[Lucian Veilcross]] for the ball.

We cast a bunch of spells and convince the chamberlain to give us a tour of the entire house.  We loot the keys off of the Chamberlain. We end up killing the Chamberlain and burning his body. The body emits black smoke.

We found a locket in the chest inside of a silver necklace (half locket) shaped as a half heart.
