**Recap**

Isabelle, Gordo and D entered [[Candlekeep]] in search of a solution to a curse that looms over [[Va]].  They gained entry to [[Candlekeep]] by donating an extremely rare book [[Bloodlines of the Golden Throne The Royal Lineage of Omu]]. They were then escorted to a sage [[Matreous]] who was consumed with researching a mighty sage [[Fistandia]]. The party agreed to assist [[Matreous]] in exchange for his expertise to life the curse on [[Va]]. Unfortunately, the party was unable to save [[Matreous]] before he was assassinated by an [[imp]].

Isabelle, Gordo and D emerge from the room where [[Matreous]]' body lay, sweaty and bloody. The Avowed sage [[Garlyth Graystock]] escorts them to [[The Hearth]] to await a hearing with an unknown high-ranking [[Avowed]] member. The group doesn't put up a fight, certain of their innocence. As they have not been found innocent of the murder just yet, the other patrons within [[The Hearth]] remain on edge as rumor spreads throughout the keep. 

Other [[Seekers]] gleefully chatter with the fresh gossip.

The party sits and waits for hours for an audience with this "great reader" but know very little in terms of who they are actually meeting.
