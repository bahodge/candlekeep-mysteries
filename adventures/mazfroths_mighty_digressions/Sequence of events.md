	3. The players learn that *"Cursing a town or location larger than a home typically requires the collaboration of multiple archanists because the scale and complexity of such a spell demand a range of specialized magical skills and techniques that no single individual can master alone. While a home might be cursed with relative ease by a lone practitioner using personal intent or simple hexes, a town involves a vast number of energies—both mundane and mystical—that must be manipulated simultaneously to affect the entire area. Each archanist involved may focus on different aspects of the curse, such as binding the location’s ley lines, corrupting the flow of time or luck within its boundaries, or creating environmental imbalances that affect its inhabitants. The pooling of their power is necessary to ensure the curse reaches every corner of the town, weaving an intricate web of dark magic that ensures the desired effects are persistent and far-reaching. Such a collaborative curse often requires precise coordination, as the energies involved can easily backlash if not handled with extreme care."*
