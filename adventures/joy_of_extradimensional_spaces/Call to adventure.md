It is 1492 DR (Dalereckoning) you've just entered the stricken village of [[Va]].  The town is nearly lifeless and it is a well known fact that the village is cursed. A local mage determined that the land had been cursed by some unknown blight a month ago. You've already heard that the village has pooled its resources to contract a band of mercenaries. You walk around the town and approach a distant commotion in the village center.

A scraggly man calls out to a small crowd of malnourished farmers and laborers. "We must protect our home!" he pleads, but the crowd is weak and disheartened. Dead silence lingers for what feels like a tenday until you muster enough courage and yell "I volunteer!".

You are shuffled off to the side and the man say's you're headed to [[Candlekeep]] in search of a sage who specializes in dealing with these...afflictions. He then informs you that you are not the first volunteer and instructs you to meet him at the edge of village in the morning for more details. You spend the night gathering provisions for the journey to [[Candlekeep]].
