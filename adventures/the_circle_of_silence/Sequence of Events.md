## Candlekeep

1. The party spots a small gathering at the front of the gates and investigates. [[Irony]], the young tiefling that was dispatched to [[Va]] those many weeks ago, collapses into the arms of the arms of the Archmage of the front gate. [[Teles Ahvoste]] order the crowd to disperse.
	1. The Archmage carefully gives her water and she sobs between gulps.
	2. She is covered in cuts, eyes bloodshot and face hagered. Her clothes are torn stained a milky red and she reeks of decay.
	3. A putrid gash extends from her right horn down to her cheek below her eye.
2. [[Teles Ahvoste]] order for a healer to be brought to the [[House of rest]] immediately. A junior [[Avowed]] complies and runs off and [[Irony]] is swiftly carried off.
3. The Party is summoned to the [[House of rest]] where they are invited into the room with [[Irony]]. [[Teles Ahvoste]], [[Orrin Glass]] and cleric of [[Oghma]] sit by the bedside.
4. [[Teles Ahvoste]] pulls the party aside and says that [[Irony]] believes she has only been away for 7 days when in fact it has been over a month.
5. [[Teles Ahvoste]] asks [[Irony]] to explain what happened.
6. [[Irony]] explains what happened. (her perspective)
	1. We made camp just on the outskirts of the village in 3 days after leaving [[Candlekeep]] and had planned to move in the next morning. We were stopped short due to a thick red fog and made camp just beyond it just to be careful. We awoke within the dense fog. It stained our skin and clothes. [[Garlyth Graystock|Garlyth]] encouraged us to quickly pack up camp and we headed to the village we believed was only a few miles from the campsite and made it to the village welcome sign, we heard a deep loud groan coming from somewhere up ahead. 
	2. Suddenly, an ear piercing noise shattered the air. The ground shifted beneath our feet and [[Fembris Larlancer]] was pulled into the air. He was swiftly ripped in twain by thorned tentacles. *[[Irony]] sniffles*.  [[Garlyth Graystock|Garlyth]] pulled me towards him and ran away from the village but I was struck in the head and flung into a small creek. My head was ringing and all I heard [[Garlyth Graystock|Garlyth]] screaming in agony until it abruptly stopped. I ran, without making a sound, I ran.
	3. Eventually I reached the village and hid in the first house I found for what seemed like hours. I knew I had to get back to [[Candlekeep]] and report the incident but I needed a different way out of the town to avoid whatever "thing" attacked us. So, I stealthily continued into the town, going building to building, seeing no one.
	4. Night came and I continued through the village until I reached the temple. As I approached the building, I could hear nothing. There was no wood creaking, footsteps or speech. I peered through an open window into the pitch dark interior. I could almost make out a figure when suddenly blinding light came from within the temple and I ran away as fast as I could. 
	5. I reached the northern edge of town and took refuge in a small cottage. Inside, surprisingly I met a man, [[Pavo]], some sort of mage. He was surrounded by children and elders all covered in cuts and sores. [[Pavo]] asked about the fate of [[Isabelle Batten]], [[The D]] and [[Gordo Connolibuns]]. I didn't know what to say other than you were working with [[Teles Ahvoste]] trying to lift the curse and that I had come to help. He seemed pleased at that. I asked if He had seen [[Garlyth Graystock|Garlyth]] to which he replied he hadn't. He gave me a magical pouch of [[Dust of Sneezing and Choking]] and told me to go and bring help.
	6. I made a break for the treeline across the field to the north of the village. The fog was dense and I could see almost nothing. Again, I heard a distinct noise that boomed endlessly. Behind me, I heard a cacophony of footsteps, howls and hungry mouths. I threw some dust from the pouch and heard what sounded like hundreds of creatures surrounding me cough and gasp for air. I continued. After a few hundred feet I exited the red mist.
	7. I continued back to [[Candlekeep]] and arrived 4 days later.
7. Party listens to [[Irony]]'s story and [[Teles Ahvoste]] gives them the pouch of [[Dust of Sneezing and Choking]] which was sitting on the table next to her.
8. [[Teles Ahvoste]] and the party step out of the room and [[Teles Ahvoste]] tasks the party with going directly to [[Va]] and sorting the problem themselves. 
9. A runner arrives and hands [[Teles Ahvoste]] a small scratch of parchment. He reads it with concern on his face.
10. [[Teles Ahvoste]] informs the party that [[Candlekeep]] believes that this is the work of a reviled druidic circle. He believes that a small contingent of the [[Circle of Silence]] has taken over [[Va]] with ill intent. [[Teles Ahvoste|Teles]] tells the party about the circle.
11. The party leaves [[Candlekeep]] to go to the village of [[Va]]
12. Party decides if they want to approach from the north or the west of the village.


## Solving the mystery

[[Jalen Pazt]] and [[Fin Folke]] collaborated with the [[circle of silence]] in order to destroy [[Mendal Shehboden]] and his family. [[Fin Folke]] owed the Shehboden family thousands and had no way of repaying that debt. [[Jalen Pazt]]  

The rest of the village was collateral damage. 

[[Pavo]] holds a vote to dissolve the village as it will be blighted for a century. [[Pavo]] travels to [[Candlekeep]] where he stays as a scholar, researching the [[circle of silence]].

If the party kills [[Mendal Shehboden]], there is no consequence as the entire town is rallied behind this decision. [[Mendal Shehboden]]'s wealth is redistributed between the Battens, Connolibuns, Pavo and The D.

loot:
- 4000gp
- deed to the batten house
- deed to the connolibun's house
- deed to the d's house
	- will and testiment of Fin Folke'
- [[Book of Silence]]


## Va Northern outskirts

You approach the village from the north and emerge from the woodline overlooking a fallow field. Beyond the field a milky red fog obscures a view of the town. The fog is not natural in it's shape as it forms a perfect dome over the village with an apex of at least 300ft. Outlines of fences and walls are barely dicernable at the edge of the fog.

The party approaches through a completely open field. There are no bails of hay, crops or wildlife to be seen. The ground is wet with moisture. If players taste the fog, it tastes of the purest water they've ever tasted. After traversing 100 feet into the field the party enters the fog.

The land is heavily obscured and the party's clothes, weapons and armor are stained a milky red. 

From memory, [[Isabelle Batten]], [[Gordo Connolibuns]], and [[The D]] remember where their homes are.

### Folke Farm Encounter (Hard)
If the party attempts to cross the field, they must do so without triggering 3 [[shrieker fungus]]. If a[[shrieker fungus]] is triggered, the party is attacked by 2 [[circle of silence druid]]s, 3 [[zombie]]s and 1 [[ogre zombie]].

A small fungal growth protrudes from a body dressed in the robes of the [[Avowed]].

## Folke's House

A simple farmhouse with minimal flair. All of the doors and windows are boarded up. Above the door is a symbol. A player that passes a DC 15 arcana check knows that this is the arcane symbol for "silence". Upon entering the house, the party sees that no item is out of place. The interior of the building is pristine. If the party searches the house with a DC 17 investigation, they will find a note hidden in a vase written in druidic. If the party translates the note they read "We decend in a tenday. Mark your home. Mark the target's. In silence, we heal these troubled lands.". You find a letter from [[Mendal Shehboden]]. "I wish you the best of luck on this years harvest. If you are unable to pay your debt, I will report you to the sherriff."

If a player rolls a DC 12 history check, they remember that [[Fin Folke]] leases the farm in the north of [[Va]]. Over years, his fields have become more barren, yeilding little to no food every year. He leased his farm from [[Mendal Shehboden]].

## Va Western outskirts

You approach the village from the west along a well trodden path. A wall of red fog looms 30 feet ahead of you. The wall of fog is dome-like and very tall, at least 300ft. The party knows that this is not what fog typically looks like.

The party enters the fog. After a further 500 feet of travel, the party stumbles across the remnants of a camp that was hastily packed. Cups, plates and blankets were left behind and a poorly constructed fire still smolders. [[Isabelle Batten]], [[Gordo Connolibuns]] and [[The D]] remember the town to be only a few hundred feet away. If the party rolls a DC 12 or higher investigation they will learn that the fog is expanding.

The fog is not natural in it's shape as it forms a perfect dome over the village with an apex of at least 300ft. Outlines of fences and walls are barely discernible at the edge of the fog.

From memory, [[Isabelle Batten]], [[Gordo Connolibuns]], and [[The D]] remember where their homes are.

## Va Welcome Sign
A dilapidated sign welcomes weary travelers to the "village of Va - sleepy and safe". The earth is muddy (difficult terrain) and riddled with trinkets and utensiles. 

### Welcome Sign Encounter (Hard)
If the party investigates the welcome sign or steps within 30 feet of the small creek bridge, a [[shambling mound]] and two [[needle blight]]s, one [[shrieker fungus]].

A small fungal growth protrudes from a body dressed in the robes of the [[Avowed]].

## Sparrows field

The barren field is flat but heavily obscured. The mud beneath your feet is difficult terrain. As you approach the center of the field all sound is blocked. 

In the center of the field is an effigy roughly resembling a human made of branches, sticks and leaves. A DC 12 history check would reveal tha the effigy is dressed in the formal attire of [[Lady Shehboden]]. The mouth of the effigy is open. If a player inspects the mouth of the effigy they will find a rock with a subtle purple glow. This rock emminates the Silence spell within 30ft of it. If the players remove the rock, the silence spell is dispelled until it is placed in the mouth of the effigy again. Surrounding the effigy are carefully laid dry branches emitting a pleasant aroma. With a DC 14 investigation check, a player would recognize it is oil of clove. A highly flammable oil. Players will find a flask of the oil near the effigy.

### Sparrows Field Encounter (Medium)

If the effigy is lit on fire, a piercing wail will emminate from Shehboden Hall as [[Lady Shehboden]] is also lit on fire. Additionally, a mob of 12 cultists and 2 dryads will surround the field and advance into the center of the field to attack the party.

## Batten House

A cozy cottage with two levels sits atop a small rise leading from the path. It's windows and doors are in desperate need of repair but the house itself sits in quiet dignity. Upon entering the house the party can find tools, trinkets and half built inventions littering the floor. [[Maurice Batten]] is nowhere to be found. If [[Isabelle Batten]] searches the house, she will find a headband of intellect in a secret drawer in [[Maurice Batten]]'s desk with a note describing the powers of the headband. A player can beat a 14 constitution saving throw to instantly attune to the headband, otherwise they can attune normally.

## Gaen's House

The home is of sturdy construction and shows little signs of wear. Two grotesque bodies lay in front of the house. From head to toe the bodies are covered in mushrooms and vines. Their hands are bound to their feet. Their eyes follow the party as they walk. [[Wimler Gaen]] and his wife [[Aem Gaen]] were good friends of the Battens and were the owners of the [[Wailing Wench]]. The players find nothing of value in the house.

## Wailing Wench

The front quarter of the building has caved in on itself. A player who succeeds a DC 12 dexterity check can make their way inside the tavern and unbar the front door. If a player drinks or eats anything they must succeed a DC 12 constitution saving throw or be poisoned for one hour. The players can safely take a short rest in this area.

## The Great Well

A stone and mortar well spanning 15 feet across is at the center of a walking garden. Four trees surround the well in a decorative fashion with the overgrowth crawling into the mouth of the well. Players will know that the trees have grown unnaturally large. The color of the water inside of the well is a light red, similar to the fog.

## Workhouse

A small outbuilding used to store tools for use in the Granary as well as the [[Shehboden's Field]]. The walls are lined with tools and equipment. If searched, the players find a note instructing the granary staff to move 17 pallets of grain aside on behalf of [[Fin Folke]] for "the quite ones".

## Granary

A massive building large enough to hold thousands of pallets of grain is beautifully constructed. The trim on the doors and windows is handcrafted and it can be inferred that it was quite expensive to build. There is a small sign in front of the [[Granary]] which reads "Granary of Va - Commissioned by the Shehboden Family". The door can be opened with a dc 19 slight of hand check or using the key.

The room opens to a grand but empty hall. It is damp and dusty. The party notices that there are no sacks of grain left. As the party enters the building they are again engulfed in the silence spell. They find another effigy, dressed in fine businessmen's attire. The effigy's mouth is also held agape with a stone inside. If the players remove the rock, the silence spell is dispelled. If the silence spell is lifted, the party will be able to hear a faint pages ruffling in the wind. Upon inspection the party will find a ledger documenting the full transaction history of the [[Granary]]. If the party spends 10 minutes reading the ledger, they will learn that [[Fin Folke]] has deposited only 182 sacks of grain this entire year and [[Mendal Shehboden]] deposited 538 sacks. With a DC 14 investigation check, the party discovers that [[Jalen Pazt]] has been reducing a significant number of deposited sacks of grain by marking them as spoiled and discarded.

## Shehboden's Field

	The field is verdant and full of life. The crops are ripe and ready for harvest. Compared to the other fields in [[Va]], [[Shehboden's Field]] is remarkably pristine. If the players eat any of the food in the field they must make a DC 17 constitution savings throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. There is an effigy made of wood in the center of the field. It is dressed as [[Mendal Shehboden]]. Inside, there is a glowing stone. The effigy is coated with a flammable oil. If the effigy is set on fire, [[Mendal Shehboden]] will be incinerated.

## Pazt's Hut

Home of [[Jalen Pazt]] and his late son [[Eldeno Pazt]]. The hut is in terrible condition. The bedding is rotted and all the walls are soaked. If the party makes a DC 14 perception check, they will see that there is a symbol of silence above the door frame.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/384b1ecd-aa9e-4e5a-af0f-4e96219a09e1)

If the party searches the hut they will find [[Jalen Pazt's Journel]]. If they spend 10 minutes reading the journel they will learn that Jalen felt profound loss after the death of his son Eldeno. "That fucking dwarf boy (Gordo) shouldn't have taunted my Eldeno to jump across those rocks". He would go on to describe how life was no longer meaningful and that the only person to offer him some comfort was [[Lady Shehboden]]. Over several graphically detailed entries, Jalen admits to having an affair with [[Lady Shehboden]] leading to an unintended pregnancy that [[Mendal Shehboden]] doesn't yet know about. The last entry of the journal reads "I need to talk to Folke about these shipments. Mendal is getting suspicious."

The party also finds keys to the [[Granary]]. note **Jalen manages the town's granary.

### Pazt's Tree

If [[The D]] searches the tree, he will find 3gp and a locket with a picture of himself (worth 12gp) that he stashed there just in case he ever needed to flee town and start a new life. 

## Pavo's Cottage

The cottage is in great disrepair. The door is ajar and only darkness is seen through the crack. If the party enters the cottage they will see [[Pavo]] and 13 other villagers. All are wounded and unable to travel. A player that casts lesser restoration will allow one villager to be strong enough to travel. [[Pavo]] describes the situation as dire. 

1. After you left 3 weeks ago, it only got worse. My magical abilities were first impeded with a great silence that decended across the town.
2. I have determined that we have been cursed by druids.
3. I have been able to collect as many people as I can and hide them in my cottage.
4. I saw [[Fin Folke]] speaking with one of the druids before they cut his throat.
5. There are effigies in town. They have some sort of stones in their mouths that inhibit magic.
6. [[Jalen Pazt]] mentioned to [[Pavo]] that he was headed to [[Mendal Shehboden]]'s hall to go over the month's production numbers but he never returned.
7. There is something going on in the [[Granary]] but it's locked. [[Jalen Pazt]] runs the building, maybe he has the key.

## Shehboden Hall

A massive building, constructed in two parts. The northern half built over a century ago and the southern half built within the last 5 years. The building is beautifully crafted, with intricate carvings decorating doors and windows. It emanates wealth and prestige.

The southern half of the building is the dedicated meeting hall. The northern serves as the home of the Shehboden family. The interior of the building is covered in magical darkness except for a small ring in the center.

If the party is able to sneak into the building and find the center of the room, they will find both [[Mendal Shehboden]] and [[Lady Shehboden]] tied up and inverted.  [[Lady Shehboden]] is incapacitated and unresponsive. [[Mendal Shehboden]] describes the ordeal and his captors. He says that there is a troll somewhere in the hall. There is also a book in the center of the room, the [[Book of Silence]]. The commotion will trigger a fight with a [[troll]] and a [[cultist fanatic]] will attack them.  If the party touches the book of silence the darkness is dispelled revealing an ambushing [[troll]] and [[cultist fanatic]]. If the party proceeds without clearing the darkness they are ambushed and surprised.

If the party searches the northern portion of Shehboden Hall, they will find a vault. With a DC 14 slight of hand, they can open the vault. Inside, they find a ledger belonging to [[Mendal Shehboden]]. It shows a loan for [[Fin Folke]] with a criminal interest rate. The party finds the body of [[Jalen Pazt]] spread eagle and naked on the master bed with a knife lodged in his throat.

If the party frees [[Mendal Shehboden]], he requests that the party takes [[Lady Shehboden]] with them. He refuses to support her after her affair with [[Jalen Pazt]].
