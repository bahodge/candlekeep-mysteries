## Candlekeep

1. The party spots a small gathering at the front of the gates and investigates. [[Irony]], the young tiefling that was dispatched to [[Va]] those many weeks ago, collapses into the arms of the arms of the Archmage of the front gate. [[Teles Ahvoste]] order the crowd to disperse.
	1. The Archmage carefully gives her water and she sobs between gulps.
	2. She is covered in cuts, eyes bloodshot and face hagered. Her clothes are torn stained a milky red and she reeks of decay.
	3. A putrid gash extends from her right horn down to her cheek below her eye.
2. [[Teles Ahvoste]] order for a healer to be brought to the [[House of rest]] immediately. A junior [[Avowed]] complies and runs off and [[Irony]] is swiftly carried off.
3. The Party is summoned to the [[House of rest]] where they are invited into the room with [[Irony]]. [[Teles Ahvoste]], [[Orrin Glass]] and cleric of [[Oghma]] sit by the bedside.
4. [[Teles Ahvoste]] pulls the party aside and says that [[Irony]] believes she has only been away for 7 days when in fact it has been over a month.
5. [[Teles Ahvoste]] asks [[Irony]] to explain what happened.
6. [[Irony]] explains what happened. (her perspective)
	1. We made camp just on the outskirts of the village in 3 days after leaving [[Candlekeep]] and had planned to move in the next morning. We were stopped short due to a thick red fog and made camp just beyond it just to be careful. We awoke within the dense fog. It stained our skin and clothes. [[Garlyth Graystock|Garlyth]] encouraged us to quickly pack up camp and we headed to the village we believed was only a few miles from the campsite and made it to the village welcome sign, we heard a deep loud groan coming from somewhere up ahead. 
	2. Suddenly, an ear piercing noise shattered the air. The ground shifted beneath our feet and [[Fembris Larlancer]] was pulled into the air. He was swiftly ripped in twain by thorned tentacles. *[[Irony]] sniffles*.  [[Garlyth Graystock|Garlyth]] pulled me towards him and ran away from the village but I was struck in the head and flung into a small creek. My head was ringing and all I heard [[Garlyth Graystock|Garlyth]] screaming in agony until it abruptly stopped. I ran, without making a sound, I ran.
	3. Eventually I reached the village and hid in the first house I found for what seemed like hours. I knew I had to get back to [[Candlekeep]] and report the incident but I needed a different way out of the town to avoid whatever "thing" attacked us. So, I stealthily continued into the town, going building to building, seeing no one.
	4. Night came and I continued through the village until I reached the temple. As I approached the building, I could hear nothing. There was no wood creaking, footsteps or speech. I peered through an open window into the pitch dark interior. I could almost make out a figure when suddenly blinding light came from within the temple and I ran away as fast as I could. 
	5. I reached the northern edge of town and took refuge in a small cottage. Inside, surprisingly I met a man, [[Pavo]], some sort of mage. He was surrounded by children and elders all covered in cuts and sores. [[Pavo]] asked about the fate of [[Isabelle Batten]], [[The D]] and [[Gordo Connolibuns]]. I didn't know what to say other than you were working with [[Teles Ahvoste]] trying to lift the curse and that I had come to help. He seemed pleased at that. I asked if He had seen [[Garlyth Graystock|Garlyth]] to which he replied he hadn't. He gave me a magical pouch of [[Dust of Sneezing and Choking]] and told me to go and bring help.
	6. I made a break for the treeline across the field to the north of the village. The fog was dense and I could see almost nothing. Again, I heard a distinct noise that boomed endlessly. Behind me, I heard a cacophony of footsteps, howls and hungry mouths. I threw some dust from the pouch and heard what sounded like hundreds of creatures surrounding me cough and gasp for air. I continued. After a few hundred feet I exited the red mist.
	7. I continued back to [[Candlekeep]] and arrived 4 days later.
7. Party listens to [[Irony]]'s story and [[Teles Ahvoste]] gives them the pouch of [[Dust of Sneezing and Choking]] which was sitting on the table next to her.
8. [[Teles Ahvoste]] and the party step out of the room and [[Teles Ahvoste]] tasks the party with going directly to [[Va]] and sorting the problem themselves. 
9. A runner arrives and hands [[Teles Ahvoste]] a small scratch of parchment. He reads it with concern on his face.
10. [[Teles Ahvoste]] informs the party that [[Candlekeep]] believes that this is the work of a reviled druidic circle. He believes that a small contingent of the [[Circle of Silence]] has taken over [[Va]] with ill intent. [[Teles Ahvoste|Teles]] tells the party about the circle.
11. The party leaves [[Candlekeep]] to go to the village of [[Va]]
12. Party decides if they want to approach from the north or the west of the village.


## Va Northern outskirts

You approach the village from the north and emerge from the woodline overlooking a fallow field. Beyond the field a milky red fog obscures a view of the town. The fog is not natural in it's shape as it forms a perfect dome over the village with an apex of at least 300ft. Outlines of fences and walls are barely dicernable at the edge of the fog.

The party approaches through a completely open field. There are no bails of hay, crops or wildlife to be seen. The ground is wet with moisture. If players taste the fog, it tastes of the purest water they've ever tasted. After traversing 100 feet into the field the party enters the fog.

The land is heavily obscured and the party's clothes, weapons and armor are stained a milky red. 

From memory, [[Isabelle Batten]], [[Gordo Connolibuns]], and [[The D]] remember where their homes are.

### Folke Farm Encounter (Hard)
If the party attempts to cross the field, they must do so without triggering 3 [[shrieker fungus]]. If  a[[shrieker fungus]] is triggered, the party is attacked by 2 [[circle of silence druid]]s, 3 [[zombie]]s and 1 [[ogre zombie]].

A small fungal growth protrudes from a body dressed in the robes of the [[Avowed]].



## Va Western outskirts

You approach the village from the west along a well trodden path. A wall of red fog looms 30 feet ahead of you. The wall of fog is dome-like and very tall, at least 300ft. The party knows that this is not what fog typically looks like.

The party enters the fog. After a further 500 feet of travel, the party stumbles across the remnants of a camp that was hastily packed. Cups, plates and blankets were left behind and a poorly constructed fire still smolders. [[Isabelle Batten]], [[Gordo Connolibuns]] and [[The D]] remember the town to be only a few hundred feet away. If the party rolls a DC 12 or higher investigation they will learn that the fog is expanding.

The fog is not natural in it's shape as it forms a perfect dome over the village with an apex of at least 300ft. Outlines of fences and walls are barely discernible at the edge of the fog.

From memory, [[Isabelle Batten]], [[Gordo Connolibuns]], and [[The D]] remember where their homes are.

## Va Welcome Sign
A dilapidated sign welcomes weary travelers to the "village of Va - sleepy and safe". The earth is muddy (difficult terrain) and riddled with trinkets and utensiles. 

### Welcome Sign Encounter (Hard)
If the party investigates the welcome sign or steps within 30 feet of the small creek bridge, a [[shambling mound]] and two [[needle blight]]s, one [[shrieker fungus]].

A small fungal growth protrudes from a body dressed in the robes of the [[Avowed]].
