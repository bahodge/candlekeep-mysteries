One of [[Candlekeep]]'s guests. Chaotic good ogre.

Got his name by killing a halfling and taking his headband of intellect. Upon attuning to the headband, he realized the error of his ways and swore to right his wrongs.

He headed to [[Candlekeep]] and has been a guest for years, reading everything they have to offer.

**Is willing to share all information he has for free**
