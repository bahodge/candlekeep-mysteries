Astra Vorn is a half-elf florist living in the town of [[Maerin]]. They run a flower stall in the town's center marketplace, and are one of the permanent vendors in the town.   Astra was a child when their family left [[Vermeillon]], so their knowledge of the forgotten village is clouded by time and the hazy memories of the very young. They remember the disaster at the mine, bits of conversation overheard from adults talking in hushed whispers, and the gossip of the other children. Astraâ€™s family fled the village when both he and his mother began to experience nightmares. They settled right outside of Maerin and started a flower farm, which Astra runs to this day.   An avid dream journaler, Astra has volumes of his family's dream history. This includes books that contain entries of their nightmares from [[Vermeillon]].
