We serve the  [[Arch Devil Ginzeval]], collector of souls and corruption. He has set his sights on [[Lucian Veilcross]] in [[Eldorra]].

We must find [[Lucian Veilcross]] find his cracks and widen them until he breaks. Basically we need to corrupt [[Lucian Veilcross]] to make corrupting everyone else.

We speak with [[Arch Devil Ginzeval]]. He tells us that we need high level souls for the battle the celestials.
