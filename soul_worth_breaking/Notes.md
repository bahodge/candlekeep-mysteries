## Mission

We serve the  [[Ginzeval]], collector of souls and corruption. He has set his sights on [[Lucian Veilcross]] in [[Eldoria]].

We must find [[Lucian Veilcross]] find his cracks and widen them until he breaks. Basically we need to corrupt [[Lucian Veilcross]] to make corrupting everyone else.
We will probably have to discover multiple weaknesses and use them all to corrupt [[Lucian Veilcross]]. We don't want to want to kill them, we want to corrupt them.

## Briefing
We speak with [[Ginzeval]]. He tells us that we need high level souls for the battle the celestials.

[[Eldoria]] was the target years ago but [[Lucian Veilcross]] foiled the attack. There was a rift that was opened just outside the city but the [[Ginzeval]]'s forces were stopped at [[Dunmere]]. [[Lucian Veilcross]] used the mountain to crush the city and stop the attack. [[Lucian Veilcross]] might feel guilty about it.

[[Eldoria]] is closely aligned to [[Lethander]]. [[Ginzeval]] gives us a map of [[Eldoria]]. We also learn that [[Eldoria]]ns do not like devils or tieflings so we can use that against them.

[[Lucian Veilcross]] is the commander of the city and likely would be near the castle.

We are given the contract to bind [[Lucian Veilcross]] to [[Ginzeval]]. Once the contract is signed, [[Ginzeval]] will be notified.
