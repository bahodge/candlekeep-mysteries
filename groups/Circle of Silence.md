Little is know about this evil druidic circle. They are led by an psychotic and malevolent leader who has never been seen but is said to possess immense power. They believe that nature should remain untainted and that all civilization that does not live in harmony with nature should be annihilated.

They are named the Circle of Silence because after they purge a town, silence looms for decades as nature reclaims the land.

The size of the circle is unknown but likely consists of at least 300 individuals.
