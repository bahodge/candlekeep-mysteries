[[Seekers]] engage in quiet study and research with this austere cluster of closely huddled, flat-topped towers of varying heights. Each tower contains private rooms, available by reservation only, that feature permanent [[silence]] spells, allowing their occupants to read without disturbance. Most research conducted by [[Seekers]] happens in these towers. [[Seekers]] at the pillars must rely on their [[Avowed]] guides to retrieve or return specific works from the [[Great Library]] to assist with their research.
