A norther neighborhood not far from the [[Wide]]. This district is part of the [[Outer City]], a sprawl of settlements that stretch beyond the city's actual walls. The [[Outer City]] is home to [[Baldur's Gate]]'s poorer inhabitants who live in ramshackle huts and flimsy tents - a stark contract to the opulence of the [[Upper City]]. Merchants with wares to meager - or too illicit - to sell in the [[Wide]] make do with unregulated back ally markets here. The stench of stabled horsed and other beasts of burden permeates the air.
