Nestled at the foot of a mountain range, the town is the last bastion of civiliation before the inhospitable climate of the peaks. Not large enough to be called a city, Maerin is noetheless bustling. Shops, taverns, and other establishments abound, as well as an open air market at the center of town where vendors of all sorts hawk their wares.

Most citizens in town have little knowledge of the village hidden in the mountains above. 

The owner of the [[Bored Weasel]], [[Lukas Grosvenor]] and [[Astra Vorn]], a flower vendor in the market do know of [[Vermeillon]].
